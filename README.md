# motor_vehicle_theft
The New Zealand police department need help to raise awareness about motor vehicle thefts.  The police department plans to release a public service anouncement to encourage citizens to be aware of thefts and stay safe.




The Goal: Find details on when, which and where vehicles are most likely to be stolen




Objective 1: Identify when vehicles are likely to be stolen

Explore the vehicle and date fields in the stolen_vehicles table to identify when vehicles tend to be stolen.
Find the number of vehicles stolen each year, month, day of the week
Create a bar chart 

Objective 2:  Identify which vehicles are likely to be stolen

Explore vehicle type, age, luxury vs standard and color in the stolen_vehicles table 
Find the vehicle types that are most often and least often stolen
For each type, find the average age of the cars that are stolen and the percent of vehicles that are luxury vs standard
Create a table to represent the top 10 vehicles
Create a heat map

Objective 3: Identify where vehicles are likely stolen

Explore the population and density statistics in the regions table to identify where vehicles are getting stolen, and visualize the results
Find the number of vehicles that were stolen in each region
Do the types of vehicles stolen in the three most dense regions differ from the three least regions?
Create a scatter plot of population vs density
Create a map of the regions







Key Insights:


The overall number of thefts is increasing month over month.
Vehicles have the highest probability of being stolen on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Vehicle-risk in higher population cities like Auckland
Beware whether you live in a high-density or a low density city, vehicles such as stationwagons, saloon, and especially trailers with colors like silver, white, and black are a high target!
The police department should prioritize on spreading more awareness in the bigger cities about what type of vehicles and colors that are more prone to theft
Also teaching about safe practices to deter theft
